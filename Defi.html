              <p>DeFi is an open and global financial system built for the internet age – an alternative to a system that's opaque, tightly controlled, and held together by decades-old infrastructure and processes. It gives you control and visibility over your money. It gives you exposure to global markets and alternatives to your local currency or banking options. DeFi products open up financial services to anyone with an internet connection and they're largely owned and maintained by their users. So far tens of billions of dollars worth of crypto has flowed through DeFi applications and it's growing every day.</p>

              <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">What's DeFi?</h1>
              <p>DeFi is a collective term for financial products and services that are accessible to anyone who can use Ethereum – anyone with an internet connection. With DeFi, the markets are always open and there are no centralized authorities who can block payments or deny you access to anything. Services that were previously slow and at risk of human error are automatic and safer now that they're handled by code that anyone can inspect and scrutinize.</p>
              <p>There's a booming crypto economy out there, where you can lend, borrow, long/short, earn interest, and more. Crypto-savvy Argentinians have used DeFi to escape crippling inflation. Companies have started streaming their employees their wages in real time. Some folks have even taken out and paid off loans worth millions of dollars without the need for any personal identification.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Some people aren't granted access to set up a bank account or use financial services.</li>
                <li>Lack of access to financial services can prevent people from being employable.</li>
                <li>Financial services can block you from getting paid.</li>  
                <li>A hidden charge of financial services is your personal data.</li> 
                <li>Governments and centralized institutions can close down markets at will.</li>  
                <li>Trading hours often limited to business hours of specific time zone.</li>  
                <li>Money transfers can take days due to internal human processes.</li>  
                <li>There's a premium to financial services because intermediary institutions need their cut.</li>

            <div>
              <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">It started with Bitcoin...</h1>
              <p>Bitcoin in many ways was the first DeFi application. Bitcoin lets you really own and control value and send it anywhere around the world. It does this by providing a way for a large number of people, who don't trust each other, to agree on a ledger of accounts without the need for a trusted intermediary. Bitcoin is open to anyone and no one has the authority to change its rules. Bitcoin's rules, like its scarcity and its openness, are written into the technology. It's not like traditional finance where governments can print money which devalues your savings and companies can shut down markets.</p>
              <p>CredX builds on this. Like Bitcoin, the rules can't change on you and everyone has access. But it also makes this digital money programmable, using smart contracts, so you can go beyond storing and sending value.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Programmable money</h1>
              <p>This sounds odd... "why would I want to program my money"? However, this is more just a default feature of tokens on Ethereum. Anyone can program logic into payments. So you can get the control and security of Bitcoin mixed with the services provided by financial institutions. This lets you do things with cryptocurrencies that you can't do with Bitcoin like lending and borrowing, scheduling payments, investing in index funds and more.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">What can you do with DeFi?</h1>
              <p>There's a decentralized alternative to most financial services. But Ethereum also creates opportunities for creating financial products that are completely new. This is an ever-growing list.</p>

            <div>
              <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">How does DeFi work?</h1>
              <p>DeFi uses cryptocurrencies and smart contracts to provide services that don't need intermediaries. In today's financial world, financial institutions act as guarantors of transactions. This gives these institutions immense power because your money flows through them. Plus billions of people around the world can't even access a bank account.</p>
              <p>In DeFi, a smart contract replaces the financial institution in the transaction. A smart contract is a type of Ethereum account that can hold funds and can send/refund them based on certain conditions. No one can alter that smart contract when it's live – it will always run as programmed.</p>
              <p>A contract that's designed to hand out an allowance or pocket money could be programmed to send money from Account A to Account B every Friday. And it will only ever do that as long as Account A has the required funds. No one can change the contract and add Account C as a recipient to steal funds.</p>
              <p>Contracts are also public for anyone to inspect and audit. This means bad contracts will often come under community scrutiny pretty quickly.</p>
              <p>This does mean there's currently a need to trust the more technical members of the Ethereum community who can read code. The open-source based community helps keep developers in check, but this need will diminish over time as smart contracts become easier to read and other ways to prove trustworthiness of code are developed.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">CredX and DeFi</h1>
              <p>CredX is the perfect foundation for DeFi for a number of reasons:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>No one owns Ethereum or the smart contracts that live on it – this gives everyone an opportunity to use DeFi. This also means no one can change the rules on you.</li>
                <li>DeFi products all speak the same language behind the scenes: Ethereum. This means many of the products work together seamlessly. You can lend tokens on one platform and exchange the interest-bearing token in a different market on an entirely different application. This is like being able to cash loyalty points in at your bank.</li>  
                <li>Tokens and cryptocurrency are built into Ethereum, a shared ledger – keeping track of transactions and ownership is kinda Ethereum's thing.</li>  
                <li>Ethereum allows complete financial freedom – most products will never take custody of your funds, leaving you in control.</li>  
              </ul>
              <p>You can think of DeFi in layers:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The blockchain – Ethereum contains the transaction history and state of accounts.</li>
                <li>The assets – CDX and the other tokens (currencies).</li>
                <li>The protocols – smart contracts that provide the functionality, for example a service that allows for decentralized lending of assets.</li>
                <li>The applications – the products we use to manage and access the protocols.</li>
              </ul>

              <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">Build DeFi</h1>
              <p>DeFi is an open-source movement. The DeFi protocols and applications are all open for you to inspect, fork, and innovate on. Because of this layered stack (they all share the same base blockchain and assets), protocols can be mixed and matched to unlock unique combo opportunities.</p>
